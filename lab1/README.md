# Public utility Evergy saves over 120,000 hours per year with Power Platform
## Company Motivators
Evergy has struggled throught the years to monitor the condition of power lines as it was a very expensive manual process requiring manual inspection overhead in a helicopter using pen and paper.
- One of the first motivators for their full migration to the cloud, was when an intern developer used Power Automate to build a robotic process automation solution that automates the back-end processes, they ended up doing 3 days of work in one night.
- After the successfull story with Power Automate, they ultimatey decided to move totally to it because of the integration with the broader Power Platform.
- Additionally, with Power Automate and the broader Power Platform, they graduated from being an RPA team to thinking more like an innovation team, which is a radical change.
- Ultimately, after all the successfull apps built within power apps, they ended up freeing 120 000 hours per year so that employees can focus on higher value activities
## Questions to ask
One of the questions I could ask them:
- What was the migration strategy ?
- What were the biggest technical challenges?
- What are the main objective for moving to the cloud?
- How did they built a team ? did they hire an consultancy company in cloud that helped them do the migration or they relied on their internal teams ?

## Most likely migration approach
Evergy's migration fits the Lift and Reshape model because they moved their business processes to the cloud and then made optimizations.
Also, they implemented the Drop and shop, instead of building their own automation tools from scratch they opted for a Cloud solution which in our case is Microsoft Power Platform.
## Schedule
- Planning (1-3 Months)
- Development (2-5 Months)
- Scaling (6-12 Months)
- Optimization (Up to 12 months)
## Main Decision criteria for choosing Evergy
I previously worked with a client in Energy sector, therefore I automatically went to filter the stories by this sector to discover how a company in this sector migrated to the cloud.
